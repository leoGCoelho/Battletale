## Plot
Howdy!

I'm Flowey!

Flowey, the flower!

I want to test you to see if you have the same determination. Your goal is simple, my dear:
Defeat the Annoying Dog.

## Gameplay

To do this, fight him to end your life, or show him mercy and just argue with him. If your life is running out, use an item to retrieve it, but remember, you only have one item.
To defend yourself from Annoying Dog, you must go through the puzzles without failing, otherwise you will take a small damage.
Good luck! ;)
